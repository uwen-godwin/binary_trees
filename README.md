- Average Time Complexity: O(log n)

### Searching

- File: `<insert file name>`
- Description: Implementation of searching operation for an AVL tree.
- Average Time Complexity: O(log n)

## Binary Heap Operations

### Insertion

- File: `131-heap_insert.c`
- Description: Implementation of insertion operation for a Max Binary Heap.
- Average Time Complexity: O(log n)

### Heap Validation

- File: `<insert file name>`
- Description: Implementation of function to check if a binary tree is a valid Max Binary Heap.
- Time Complexity: O(n)

### Array to Heap Conversion

- File: `132-array_to_heap.c`
- Description: Implementation of function to build a Max Binary Heap tree from an array.
- Time Complexity: O(n)

### Extraction

- File: `133-heap_extract.c`
- Description: Implementation of function to extract the root node of a Max Binary Heap.
- Time Complexity: O(log n)

### Heap to Sorted Array Conversion

- File: `134-heap_to_sorted_array.c`
- Description: Implementation of function to convert a Binary Max Heap to a sorted array of integers.
- Time Complexity: O(n log n)

## Compilation

To compile the files, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o binary_trees
